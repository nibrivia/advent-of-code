# Day 1

## Part one

"Follow the frequency changes"

```{r day-1, }
day_1 <- read_csv("inputs/day-1", col_names = "freq_change") %>% 
  mutate(n = seq_along(freq_change),
         freq = cumsum(freq_change))

day_1 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = n,
             y = freq)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_ipsum_rc()

final_freq <- day_1 %>% tail(n=1) %>% .$freq
```

The final frequency is `r final_freq`.
